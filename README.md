# UsePopcorn

Welcome to UsePopcorn Movies, a movie database web application where users can search for movies, view IMDb ratings, manage their watchlist, and rate movies they've watched. This project showcases the implementation of React hooks, `useState` and `useEffect`, for managing state and handling side effects, and API fetching for retrieving movie data.

## Features

- **Search Bar**: Users can easily search for movies using keywords.
- **Movie List**: Displays a list of movies based on the user's search query.
- **Movie Details**: Users can select a specific movie to view its IMDb rating, runtime, and other details.
- **User Ratings**: Users have the ability to rate movies they've watched.
- **Watchlist**: Users can create a personal watchlist of movies they plan to watch or have watched already.
- **User Statistics**: The application displays the user's average rating, the number of movies they've rated, and the number of movies they've watched.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Hooks: Utilized `useState` for managing component state without writing class components and `useEffect` for handling side effects.
- API Fetching: Used API requests to retrieve movie data and ratings.
- HTML & CSS: Structured the app's layout and applied styling for an appealing user interface.
